# Error Handling Exercises in Python

Each exercise covers a specific error handling concept, from basic try-except blocks to custom exceptions and retry mechanisms.

1. Basic Try-Except
    - Prompts the user for two numbers and divides them.
    - Handles division by zero (ZeroDivisionError).

2. Multiple Exception Handling
    - Accesses elements from a list based on user input.
    - Handles IndexError (invalid index) and ValueError (invalid input type).

3. Else Clause
    - Attempts to open and read a file.
    - Prints a success message if no exception occurs.

4. Finally Clause
    - Demonstrates the use of the `finally` block, which executes regardless of whether an exception occurred.

5. Custom Exception
    - Defines and raises a custom exception `NegativeAgeError` for negative age input.

6. Comprehensive Error Handling
    - Simulates a simple banking application with withdrawal logic.
    - Handles negative input, insufficient funds, and other errors.

7. Nested Try-Except
    - Illustrates using nested try-except blocks for multi-level error handling.

8. Retry Mechanism
    - Implements a retry mechanism for division, allowing up to three attempts before exiting.
